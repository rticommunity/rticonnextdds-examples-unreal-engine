# rticonnextdds-examples-unreal-engine

This repository contains examples of how to use **RTI Connext DDS®** with **Unreal Engine**.

## Connext Example

This is a simple example that modifies the **Unreal** Vehicle game project to publish the vehicle state with **DDS** and route commands through DDS from the keyboard to the vehicle.  See this [README](./ConnextExample/README.md).
